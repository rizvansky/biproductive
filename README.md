## Description
This repository contains the application BiProductive, which analyzes the habits of the person, tests his productivity, 
and defines dependencies between habits and productivity. Each day user enters the actions they made today (sports 
activity, meditation, smoking, etc.) and tests their brain performance. Then the application computes the correlation 
between habits and user's performance, and makes personal recommendations.
